# 📚 Learning Management System (LMS)

A full-featured, role-based LMS built with *ReactJS, **Firebase, and **Razorpay* to support Admin, Teacher, and Student workflows.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

### Frontend
- *ReactJS*
- *React Router DOM*
- *Tailwind CSS*
- *PostCSS* and *Autoprefixer*

### Backend & Services
- *Firebase Authentication* – handles login, signup, role assignment
- *Firebase Firestore* – NoSQL database for storing user data, courses, tests, etc.
- *Firebase Hosting* (or Vite Dev Server)
- *Firebase Storage* – for resource files (PDFs, videos)

### Payment Integration
- *Razorpay* – for processing payments for paid courses

---

## 🔐 Authentication Logic

- Firebase Authentication handles login and session management
- AuthContext (React Context) manages global state and user role

---

## 🧠 Routing & Component Logic

- *React Router DOM* handles client-side routing
- *Protected Routes*: Redirect unauthenticated users
- *Dynamic Routes*: Course details, test pages, etc.
- UI updates based on the role stored in Firebase

---

## 📂 Firebase Firestore Structure (Suggested)

```json
users/
  userId/
    name, email, role

courses/
  courseId/
    title, description, teacherId, isPaid, price, resources[]

tests/
  testId/
    courseId, questions[], dueDate

enrollments/
  userId/
    courseIds[]


⸻

💳 Payment Flow (Razorpay)
	1.	Student adds a paid course to cart
	2.	Razorpay checkout is triggered
	3.	On success:
	•	Student is enrolled in the course
	•	Entry added to Firestore enrollments
	4.	On failure:
	•	Razorpay returns error, no enrollment happens

⸻

🧪 Test Feature
	•	Teachers can create quizzes with multiple choice or descriptive questions
	•	Tests are associated with specific courses
	•	Students can only access tests for enrolled courses
	•	Responses stored in Firestore
	•	Teachers/Admins can review and evaluate
